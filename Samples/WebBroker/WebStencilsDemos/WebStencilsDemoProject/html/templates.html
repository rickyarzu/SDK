<h1 class="my-text-gradient">Layout and Content Placeholders</h1>
    <p>WebStencils provides a powerful layout system similar to other template engines like Razor. This system allows
        you to define a common structure for your pages and inject specific content into that structure.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">@@LayoutPage</h3>
    <p>The <code>@@LayoutPage</code> directive is used in a content page to specify which layout template should be used
        as the structure for that page. It's typically placed at the top of the content file:</p>

		@Import partials/codeBlock { @code = @codeLayoutPage }

    <h3 class="mt-4">@@RenderBody</h3>
    <p>The <code>@@RenderBody</code> directive is used in the layout template to indicate where the content from the
        specific page should be inserted. For example, in your <code>BaseTemplate.html</code>:</p>
    
		@Import partials/codeBlock { @code = @codeRenderBody }

    <h3 class="mt-4">@@Import</h3>
    <p>The <code>@@Import</code> directive allows you to merge an external file into a specific location in the current
        template. This is useful for creating reusable components. </p>
    <p>This directive allows structuring your templates in nested folders. It’s also possible to omit the file
        extension, as long as the default one has been defined in the Engine or Processor.</p>

		@Import partials/codeBlock { @code = @codeImport }
		
	<h2 class="mt-5">Template Patterns</h2>
	<p>WebStencils supports several common template patterns that can help you organize your application's views
			effectively.</p>

	<h3 class="mt-5">Standard Layout</h3>
	<p>This pattern uses the built-in <code>@@LayoutPage</code> and <code>@@RenderBody</code> approach we've already
			discussed. It's ideal for maintaining a consistent structure across your site while allowing individual pages to
			provide their specific content. This demo follows this pattern.</p>

	<h3 class="mt-5">Header/Body/Footer</h3>
	<p>In this pattern, each page is an individual template, but they all share common parts like headers and footers.
			Instead of using a layout page, you might structure your templates like this:</p>
			
	@Import partials/codeBlock { @code = @codeHeaderBodyFooter }				

	<p>This approach offers more flexibility than the standard layout pattern but may require more management of common
			elements.</p>

	<h3 class="mt-5">Reusable Components</h3>
	<p>Using the <code>@@Import</code> directive, you can define individual sets of components that can be reused
			throughout your application. This directive also allows passing of iterable objects and even defining aliases
			for a more agnostic component definition. For example:</p>
			
	@Import partials/codeBlock { @code = @codeReusableComponents }				

	<p>This pattern allows you to break your UI into smaller, manageable pieces that can be easily maintained and reused
			across different pages. You can find some examples of this pattern in the code of this demo.</p>
