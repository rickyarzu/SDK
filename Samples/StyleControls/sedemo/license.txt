          LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ALMEDIADEV COMPONENTS
          ===============================================

This software is protected by copyright law and international copyright treaty.  
Therefore, you must treat this software just like a book, except that you 
may copy it onto a computer to be used and you may make archive copies of 
the software for the sole purpose of backing up our software and protecting 
your investment from loss.  The software may be moved from one computer 
to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used by more 
than one person at a time.

ADDING USERS
============

You may add users by paying for a separate software package for each user you 
wish to add.  You may also add users by purchasing a site-license, so long as 
the number of persons who are able to use the software at one time is not more 
than the number of authorized users specified in our package or license.

TRANSFERRING THE SOFTWARE
=========================

You may transfer all of your rights to use the software to another person, 
provided that you transfer to that person all of the software, diskettes 
(if applicable), and documentation provided in this package (including this 
statement), and transfer or destroy all copies in any form.  Remember, once 
you transfer the software, you no longer have any right to use it, and the 
person to whom it is transferred may use it only in accordance with the 
copyright law, international treaty, and this statement.

If you have purchased an upgrade version of the software, it constitutes a 
single product with the Almediadev software that you upgraded.  
For example, the upgrade and the software that you upgraded cannot both be 
available for use by two different people at the same time, and cannot be 
transferred separately, without written permission from Almediadev.

Except as provided in this statement, you may not transfer, rent, lease, 
lend, copy, modify, translate, sublicense, time-share, or electronically 
transmit or receive the software, media, or documentation.

LIMITED WARRANTY
================

The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this limited 
warranty shall be limited to replacement of defective media or documentation 
and shall not include or extend to any claim for or right to recover any other 
damages, including but not limited to, loss of profit, data, or use of the 
software or special, incidental or consequential damages, or other similar 
claims, even if Almediadev has been specifically advised of 
the possibility of such damages.  In no event will Almediadev liability 
for any damages to you or any other person ever exceed the lower of the list 
price or the actual price paid for the package or the license to use the 
software, regardless of the form of the claim.

ALMEDIADEV SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, 
OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
ALL OTHER IMPLIED TERMS ARE EXCLUDED.

Specifically, Almediadev makes no representation or warranty that the 
software or documentation are "error-free," or meet any user's particular 
standards, requirements, or needs.  In all events, any implied warranty, 
representation, condition, or other term is limited to the electronic 
distribution file(s) and online documentation and is limited to the 
60-day duration of the limited warranty.

Almediadev is not responsible for, and does not make any representation, 
warranty, or condition concerning product, media, software, or documentation 
not manufactured or supplied by Almediadev, such as 
third-parties' programs that are designed using Almediadev software or 
which include Almediadev programs or files.
